# JSYS: Doctor Alert for RedM
This Resource is basically for locations to call a doctor from.  
When the players is inside the locations radius a key info is shown.  
Default Key is R.  
  
After pressing the button the command registered by bcc-job-alerts gets executed.  
Then there is a cooldown (default: 60 seconds) until you can call the doctor again.  

You can add multiple locations with individual commands to call.  
Simply add them or change them in the config/config.lua.  

## Requires:
* Vorp Core
* bcc-job-alerts
